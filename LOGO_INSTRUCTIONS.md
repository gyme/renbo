# Renbo Logo Instructions

To use your custom Renbo logo:

1. Save your Renbo logo image as `public/renbo-logo.png`
2. The app is already configured to use it at `/renbo-logo.png`
3. If the image doesn't load, it will show a fallback text version

## Current Setup
The logo is referenced in `src/App.jsx` and will automatically use the image you place in the `public` folder.

Simply save your colorful Renbo logo (the one with R=orange, e=yellow, n=yellow, b=green, o=blue) as:
```
public/renbo-logo.png
```

And refresh the page!
